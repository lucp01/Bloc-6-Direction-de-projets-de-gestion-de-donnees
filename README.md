To write the code we have mainly used and custom several notebook (lessons & exercices) we have worked on at Jedha, as well code from Ela Kapoor (https://www.kaggle.com/elakapoor) and also code fragments, tips, advices, help, from the web (stackoverflow etc….). 

The Dataset was from Kaggle and reformat by ourself (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedownhill/art-images-drawings-painting-sculpture-engraving?resource=download).

Project developed in the framework of the end of studies project at Jedha, done in collaboration with Nansa Diarra, Frédéric Rool and myself in June 2022.
